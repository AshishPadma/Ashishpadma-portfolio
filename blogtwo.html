            <h2>1. PCLOUD</h2>
            <h3>UP TO 10GB FREE CLOUD STORAGE</h3>
            <p>pCloud's 10GB offer is yours for good - no limits, no problems. You'll need to do a few additional tasks to get the full 10GB, such as refer other users to pCloud. Otherwise, you'll be left with a fairly basic 2GB.</p>

        <div class="container container-center">
            <h2>2. SYNC.COM</h2>
            <h3>5GB FREE ENCRYPTED CLOUD STORAGE</h3>
            <p>Sync.com only offers 5GB of free cloud storage. That's enough to give it a go, but once you start using it, you may find it hard to resist the temptation of upgrading to 500GB or 2TB of the storage, There is also no file size limits, making it one of the best cloud storage options for large files.</p>

        <div class="container container-center">
            <h2>3. ICEDRIVE</h2>
            <h3>10GB FREE STORAGE</h3>
            <p>While it is new to the cloud storage scene, Icedrive is already an excellent provider that offers top-notch security and privacy, as well as good speed, a beautiful and easy to use interface and lifetime storage plans.</p>

        <div class="container container-center">
            <h2>4. GOOGLE DRIVE</h2>
            <h3>15GB FREE WITH DOCUMENT COLLABORATION</h3>
            <p>It is one of the best free cloud storge solutions, thanks to its seamless integration with Google Docs, as well as a generous 15GB storage limit for free users.</p>

        <div class="container container-center">
            <h2>5. MEGA</h2>
            <h3>50GB FREE BUT WITH STRINGS ATTACKED</h3>
            <p>The default free cloud storage amount on the free MEGA plan is 15GB. An extra 35GB is added for new users, but this expires after 30 days. You used to be able to earn bonus storage by installing the applications and referring users, but this is no longer possible. You now instead receive a 20 percent commission for each referral, which is an interesting approach. </p>
